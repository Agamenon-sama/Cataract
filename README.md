# Cataract

A port scanner for Linux

## Dependencies

For now, nothing except the C++ standard library

## Build

```
cd build
make
```

I currently have a problem where make doesn't recompile modified files. This will be fixed but until then, every time you want to recompile, you have to use

```
make clean
make
```
